switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to execute if expression == value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to execute if expression == value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code to execute if no cases match
}
Key Points:
break prevents fall-through (without it, execution continues to the next case).

default is optional but useful as a fallback.

Best for menu-driven programs and multi-condition checks.
